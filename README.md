# Open3D-ML
An extension of Open3D to address 3D Machine Learning tasks
This repo is a proposal for the directory structure.

The repo can be used together with the precompiled open3d pip package but will also be shipped with the open3d package.
The file ```examples/train_semantic_seg.py``` contains a working example showing how the repo can be used directly and after it has been integrated in the open3d namespace.

TODO List:
- [x] tensorboard
- [x] strucutred config file
- [x] disentangle config
- [x] support yaml
- [x] validation loader
- [x] re-training
- [x] on-the-fly cached preprocessing
- [x] reorganize the dataloading and caching
- [x] dataset class in torch 
- [ ] support KPConv
- [ ] support S3DIS
- [ ] Tensorflow pipeline
- [ ] semantickitti example data for inference
- [ ] fine-tune training
- [ ] rename ml3d.torch.datasets -> ml3d.torch.dataloaders same for tf
- [ ] replace custom compiled ops with functionality in o3d if possible
- [ ] storage solution for network weights and other large binary data (Git LFS, Google, AWS)
- [ ] check code origins for all files 
  - [ ] ml3d/torch/utils/dataset_helper.py is a copy from Kaolin

## Directories

```
├─ examples             # place for example scripts and notebooks
├─ docs                 # rst files that can be integrated in the open3d docs
├─ ml3d                 # package root dir; this will become open3d/_ml3d in the package
     ├─ datasets        # generic dataset code; will beopen3d.datasets
     ├─ tf              # directory for tensorflow specific code. same structure as ml3d/torch
     ├─ torch           # directory for pytorch specific code
          ├─ datasets   # framework specific dataset code, e.g. wrappers that can make use of the generic dataset code.
          │             # This will be open3d.ml.torch.datasets with open3d.ml.torch as ml3d
          ├─ models     # modules with model code and/or packages for more complicated models.
          ├─ pipelines  # pipelines with categories as subdirectories e.g. detection, segmentation
          
```


## Build the project

## Prepare Datasets

## Visualizer
### Investigate a dataset
### Visualize a pointcloud with labels

## Inference with pretrained weights
### Test on a dataset
### Test on a pointcloud file
### APIs for inference

## Training
```
python examples/train.py torch -c ml3d/configs/randlanet_semantickitti.yml
```
```shell
python examples/train.py ${TF/torch} ${CONFIG_FILE} [optional arguments]
```
Optional arguments can be
- `--log_dir ${LOG_DIR}`: By default, the `${LOG_DIR}` is `./logs`. This directory is where all the logs, results, and checkpoints are stored.
- `--ckpt_path`:
- `--device`
- 

Examples:
Train torch model of RandLA-Net on SemanticKITTI
```shell
python examples/train.py torch ml3d/configs/randlanet_semantickitti.yaml
```
